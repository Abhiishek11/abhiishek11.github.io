<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Iâ€™m Abhishek, a first year Ph.D. student, advised by [Dr. Matthew Louis Mauriello](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mlm/) in [Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.cis.udel.edu/) at the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/), where I design tangible and interactive user interfaces to support music composition, therapeutic engagement, and accessibilityâ€”particularly for children with autism and diverse sensory preferences. I also closely work with [Dr. Daniel Stevens](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/cas/units/departments/school-of-music/our-people/daniel-stevens/).

My research bridges human-computer interaction (HCI), audio signal processing, machine learning, participatory design, accessibilty and visualizations, often through systems that combine multimodal music libraries, visualization-driven analysis, and emotion-aware recommender models. I develop tangible and immersive systems, and collaborate with music therapists, composers, and families to co-create meaningful, measurable experiences.

My work has been published at prestigious venues such as [ACM IDC](https://idc.acm.org/2025/), and [AAAI ICWSM](https://www.icwsm.org/2025/index.html), and includes contributions to open-source tools, user interfaces for affective computing, and LLM-integrated pipelines for mental health datasets designed to support research in user experience, sentiment analysis, application evaluation, and human-AI collaboration.
